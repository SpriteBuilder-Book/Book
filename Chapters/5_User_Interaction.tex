\chapter{User Interaction and Collision Detection}

In this chapter you will incorporate User Interaction into the object catching
game. The first step will be implementing a drag and drop mechanism that lets
the user move the pot in order to catch objects. To detect if the player has
catched or missed an object we will implement basic collision detection - note
that you will later learn how to use the \cocos{} physics engine that provides
collision detection out of the box. Whether you want to implement your own
collision detection or use the physics engine will depend a lot on the type of
game you are developing and we will discuss the advantages of both approaches
throughout this book.

When we've implemented the first control scheme we will add a second option for
players - controlling the game with the accelerometer of the device, another
common way to interact with mobile games.

As a byproduct of implementing these features we will work with translating
positions and sizes between different node spaces and the world space, so we
will be discussing that important concept throughout this chapter as well.
