\subsection{Which size does a background image for all four resolutions need to
have?}\label{background_all_resolutions}
Since the iPad and the iPhone have different aspect ratios your
background images need to be high enough for the iPad and wide enough for the
iPhone (assuming you have a landscape game). The perfect image size is 2272px X
1536px, here is an image that explains why:

In blue you can see the outline of an iPad. An iPad has a resolution of
1024px x 768px, \SB{} uses \textit{2x} resolution for the iPad. To get the
required \textit{4x} resolution we need to multiply the value by 2, resulting in 2048px x 1536px.
In black you can see the outline of an iPhone. A 3.5-inch iPhone has a resolution
of 480px x 320px, but we want our image to also fit the 4-inch iPhone therefore
we calculate with a resolution of 568px x 320px. This is a \textit{1x}
resolution, to get to a \textit{4x} resolution we need to multiply the values by
4, resulting in a required resolution of 2272px x 1280px. You can see, the
iPhone requires a wider image, the iPad a higher one. A resolution of 2272px X
1536px satisfies both requirements.
