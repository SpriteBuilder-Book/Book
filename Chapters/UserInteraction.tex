\chapter{User Interaction}
User Interaction is another important foundation for any game. This chapter
concludes the minimum basic understanding you need to build an actual game - and
we have a lot to discuss.

New input capabilities have revolutionized the gaming experience on mobile
devices and have created completely new genres of games. In order to create
great mobile games you need to be able to work with all the possible input types
modern iOS devices provide:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Touch Input
  \item Accelerometer Input
  \item Gesture Recognition
\end{itemize}
We will start looking at simple touch input first, since this is the easiest and
most used control scheme in games.
